NODE TEST

1. Create a new directory in /curc/admin/benchmarks/data that indicates the 
   date the benchmarks are run. I use the month-dd-yyyy format (e.g. may-25-2012).
   
2. Navigate into the new directory and create PBS scripts for the nodes you 
   would like to test using the create_node_test.py python script.
   There are several ways to do this.   
   
   a.	create_node_test.py

   b.	create_node_test.py node[01][01-80]

   c.   create_node_test.py node[01-05][01-80]

   d. 	create_node_test.py node0323
   
   e.	create_node_test.py <filename>
   
   Repeat this process until you have the desired scripts set up in the directory.

3. Submit the jobs using the submit_jobs.py script.  This will submit all the jobs
   in the directory that start with "script_".  If you make a mistake, you can 
   type kill_jobs.py to remove all the jobs that you have submitted. 
   
4. Once the jobs have finished, collect the results with evaluate_node_test.py 
   script.  By default, this script takes no arguments and computes a 10%
   threshold.
